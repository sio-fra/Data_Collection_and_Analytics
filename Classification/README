##Review Classification

###This is a script which classifies reviews for hotels, fashion and automotive businesses.

1. Reviews for these three types of businesses are first collected and categorised as being positive or negative reviews (where anything under 4 stars is deemed as negative).

2. The review data is preprocessed by removing stopwords and lemmatizing words, it is then split up into train and test data.

3. Three different classifiers are trained on the data from each of the three types of businesses and are applied to predict the class of test data.

4. The performance of each of the classification models is evaluated using an f1 score.

5. The results are displayed and the best performing models for each of the three types of businesses are tested on review data from the other types of businesses.
